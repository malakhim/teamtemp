    <p>
        This application is designed to gather 'team temperature' - that is,
        a happiness score.</p>

    <p>For the sake of security, very little information is stored or recorded.
        Each submitter is represented by a random ID, and a cookie is stored so
        really only to protect against accidental double submissions from the
        same user with the same browser.</p>

    <p>The results page are available to the creator using the same cookie
        mechanism, and also a password in case the cookie is lost.</p>

    <p>This application runs on Heroku and the source can be examined
        <a href="https://github.com/teamtemp/teamtemp">on Github</a>. You'll have
        to trust me that the same code is running on Heroku. (Although pull requests
        that make that more explicit will be considered. Indeed all reasonable pull
        requests will be considered, as will any issues raised)</p>

    <p>The application is written in django against a postgresql database.</p>
